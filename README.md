#A 16-bit ALU with APB interface

##Introduction
This design is an implementation of a 16-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). 
This Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is integrated with a set of registers that can be accessed through the APB interface. 
The registers serve as storage for operands, results, and control/status flags. The APB interface allows for easy communication with the ALU.
The ALU can perform addition and multiplication.

It was developed as part of the VTOOL digital design training program and later on verified.
